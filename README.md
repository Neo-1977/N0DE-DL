#Description 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything is for educational purposes only, and the techniques done here will NOT work against newer versions of the Services anyway since most went through upgrades in regards to Security Services, switched keys etc.It's mostly not working anymore as of 2021, but you can read the code and have a better understanding & cool features we managed to do. 

Hopefully it gives you guys ideas & show me what you can do to improve it!
